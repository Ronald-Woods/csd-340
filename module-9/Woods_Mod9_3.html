        <h2>Short Story, first take. </h2>
        <p class="intro">Once upon a time, there was a student who was learning web development. He was excited to learn all of the different <span id="word1">_______</span> that would help him build amazing web pages.</p>
        <p>He practiced multiple times a week and build super cool <span id="word2">________ </span> with HTML and CSS.</p>
        <p>One day, he was tasked to learn <span id="word3">________</span>. He was amazed at how powerful it was and how it could make his web pages interactive.</p>
        <p>He started by creating a web page that filled in <span id="word4">________</span> with the click of a button!</p>
        <button onclick="fillword1()">Click to fill in the first word</button>
        <button onclick="fillword2()">Click to fill in the second word</button>
        <button onclick="fillword3()">Click to fill in the third word</button>
        <button onclick="fillword4()">Click to fill in the fourth word</button>
